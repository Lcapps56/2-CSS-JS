# 2-CSS-SASS-JS
**GOAL** The goal of this pahse is to practice some more advanced concepts i did not know as well as dive a bit deeper in JS. languages and technologies utilized in this phase are...
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- front-end Javascript (DOM manipulation)

Project Details and Desc.
- 2 SASS youtube videos. 1 a crash course & 1 a code-along (REPO NAMES: SASS course, SASS code along)
- 1 SASS website recreate - look at a design and create the site using SASS (REPO NAME: SASS website recreate
- 1 Front end JS youtube code along. Created a draggable navigation/categories menu (REPO NAME: Sliding Categories Navbar)

**REFLECTION**. I have really enjoyed getting back into coding and coding everyday for a few hours. SASS was a lot easier than i expected, not sure how much it is used in the industry but I can see a lot of benefits to using it on bigger projects or wehn coding a design given. I will try to use it more.
The Front-end JS project was difficult for me. As JS is something i have not yet "brushed the dust off" 

**NEXT** Next I want to move a lot deeper into JS. perhaps exclusivly JS. I think i will do a few more DOM manipulation type JS projects and then the most of next phase will be stricly JS. I found a youtube playlist wiht a lot of neat JS projects
